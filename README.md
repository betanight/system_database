# Infinity Game

In this repository I will be figuring out how to make an intricate game based on multiple different ttrpg rulebooks. It will consist of many different functions as as well as a large SQL data tree that will hold characters stats and skills with endless possibilities. I have always wanted a game that can memorize and build a character from the ground up based on every little experience the player does. So I will try to make that possible here.
