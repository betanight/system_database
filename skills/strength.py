        ("Shock Absorption", "Withstand knockback or collisions by bracing effectively."),
        ("Anchor Stance", "Root yourself to resist being moved or displaced. Unlike Postural Strength, this skill is about planted positioning against force rather than upright form maintenance."),

        ("Grip Strength", "Apply focused hand and forearm force when needed. Differs from Iron Grip, which reflects holding under pressure; this focuses on baseline grip power."),
        ("Stone Stance", "Stand immovably against physical or magical push forces. This expands on Anchor Stance by applying in magical or abnormal pressure contexts."),
        ("Fist Conditioning", "Build up the toughness of your fists and arms for impact-heavy tasks."),
        ("Impact Resistance", "Naturally reduce physical shock from blunt trauma."),

        ("Lifting Form", "Apply biomechanical efficiency when performing lifting techniques."),
